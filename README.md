I am a post-doc in the Adaptive Memory Laboratory and the Ellman Laboratory at Temple University. I received my Ph.D. from Arizona State University, where my dissertation research investigated structural and functional correlates of reward-motivated episodic memory. In general, I am interested in the effects of reward on human attention and memory, and the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system.
